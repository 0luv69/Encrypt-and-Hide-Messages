# Encrypt and Hide Messages

## Introduction
This Python script provides a straightforward solution for encrypting and decrypting messages using randomization and character manipulation. It leverages the random, string, and os libraries to ensure secure message concealment and retrieval.

## Usage
To utilize the functionality of this script, simply clone the repository and execute the `encryption_msg.py` file. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt your messages.

### Encrypting Messages
When prompted, enter '0' to initiate the encryption process. This will transform your message into an encrypted form, making it suitable for secure transmission.

### Decrypting Messages
To decrypt a message, input '1' when prompted. This action reverses the encryption process, revealing the original content of the message.

## Practical Application
This script proves invaluable during conversations where privacy is paramount. Users can easily encrypt their messages before sending them, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decipher their content. Conversely, recipients can effortlessly decrypt these messages upon receipt, maintaining the integrity of their private conversations.

## File Management
The script conveniently logs both encrypted and decrypted messages in a text file. This feature enables users to track their message history and ensures seamless retrieval of previously encrypted content.
